# PRODIGY_CS_04
This is my fourth internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. I developed a basic keylogger program in Python using the pynput library. It captures keystrokes for a user-specified duration and saves the log to keylogger_log.txt. The pynput library must be installed, and superuser/administrator privileges may be required, especially on Kali Linux.
